%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide.

All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by \citet{Others2013},
and describes the problem the authors aim to solve \citep[e.g.][]{Author2012}.

\section{Numerical Simulations}
Auriga simulations. 

\section{Determining the halo shape}

%\subsection{The solid ellipsoid method}


\section{Results}
Here we present our principal results blah blah blah.

\subsection{The radial tendency of axial ratios}
First, it is important to verify that halos are rounder at larger radii, for both MHD and DM simulations.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subfloat[halo 27 DM shape at small radius]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/MHD_Vs_DM/level4_DM_halo_27_inner.png}}
  \hfill
  \subfloat[halo 27 DM shape at big radius]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/MHD_Vs_DM/level4_DM_halo_27_outter.png}}
  \hfill
  \subfloat[halo 27 MHD shape at small radius]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/MHD_Vs_DM/level4_MHD_halo_27_inner.png}}
  \hfill
  \subfloat[halo 27 MHD shape at big radius]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/MHD_Vs_DM/level4_MHD_halo_27_outter.png}}
  \caption{DM density for inner (left) and outer (right) parts of the halo 27. We present both versions of the halo: DM (up) \& MHD (down). The horizontal (vertical) axes are aligned to the major (medium) axes. (optimaze space and description) }
  \label{fig:slices}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\subfloat[halo 16]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/halo16.png}}
  \hfill
  \subfloat[halo 27]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/halo27.png}}
\caption{Radial profile for axial ratios and the triaxiality parameter $T=\frac{1-b/a}{1-c/a}$ from halo 27 and halo 16. These halos have a clear radial tendence towards sphericity (for smaller radii until $\approx 3$Kpc), which can be confirmed with the triaxiality parameter. (Merged Column)}
\label{fig:DM_MHD}
\end{figure} 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subfloat[Level4 DM inner Vs outer regions]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/Triaxial_Plane/Triaxiality_DM_lvl4.png}}
  \hfill
  \subfloat[Level4 MHD inner Vs outer regions]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/Triaxial_Plane/Triaxiality_MHD_lvl4.png}}
  \hfill
  \caption{General tendency on the triaxial plane $c/a$ Vs $b/a$. Some observational constraints are plotted alongside our results (Optimize space. caption replaces title.  Present constraints representation of density)}
  \label{fig:Triaxiality_DM_MHD}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The rounding effect of baryons}
Here we discuss the rounding effect of baryons. We quantify this rounding effect and look for correlations with important baryonic properties of the galaxy.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subfloat[Level4 MHD Vs DM at inner regions]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/Triaxial_Plane/Triaxiality_Inner_lvl4.png}}
  \hfill
  \subfloat[Level4 MHD Vs DM at outer regions]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/Triaxial_Plane/Triaxiality_Outter_lvl4.png}}
  \hfill
  \caption{Axial ratios as shown on $c/a$ Vs $b/a$. Each dot represents a halo shape at some radius. Some observational constraints are plotted alongside our results. Here, dots are clustered, proving the general tendence of halos to get rounder on the outer parts.(Optimize space. caption replaces title.  Present constraints representation of density)}
  \label{fig:Triaxiality_Inner_Outer}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./pics/Delta asphericity Vs Star Density.png}
    \caption{Difference in asphericities between MHD and DM shapes Vs Star Density of the simulation.}
    \label{fig:Star_Density_effect}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The historical shape}
Here we study the memory shape and how it can be deduced from the historic radial shapes. Also why it is lost for MHD even when radial profiles have the same historic tendencies.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subfloat[halo 16 DM]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/Redshift/halo_16_level3_DM_Z.png}}
  \hfill
  \subfloat[halo 16 MHD]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./pics/Redshift/halo_16_level3_MHD_Z.png}}
  \caption{Radial profile (comoving) of axial ratios for halo 16 in terms of redshift (color). This halo maintains its shape until $z\approx 1$ obviating the systematic rounding effect in time from asymmetric potentials. }
  \label{fig:RedshiftGood}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The orientation of the principa axes}
This is an important result of our study. We study the radial evolution of the principal axes, compared also to the angular momentum vector from the disk. We found that while the angular momentum tend to be aligned with the minor axis of the ellipsoid, this may not be the case all times. When there is an alignment it is usually within 20 degrees. When there is not an alignment, then there is no simple way to determine toward which axis it is oriented. Furthermore, the principal axes alignment usually change with radius (rotation, swap). This really questions the strong constrains on the MW DM halo models. 


\section{Conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

\section{Discussion}

\section*{Acknowledgements}



The Acknowledgements section is not numbered. Here you can thank helpful
colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc.
Try to keep it short.
